Encoder benchmarks:
Preliminary benchmarks indicate this performance:

Python 2.6 32-bit on Windows 7 x64:
ujson encode      : 58061.68741 calls/sec
simplejson encode : 19025.95344 calls/sec
cjson encode      : 15308.70966 calls/sec
json encode       : 2407.92068 calls/sec

See (python/benchmark.py) for further information.

NOTE: These benchmarks are preliminary!
